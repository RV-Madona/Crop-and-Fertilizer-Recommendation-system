# Crop-and-Fertilizer-Recommendation-system
We build crop and fertilizer recommendation system using various machine learning algorithm

1.1.	OBJECTIVE

The Objective of our model is to recommend the Crops based on soil, weather, humidity, rainfall, and other variables to increase agricultural output. In order to increase the yield of crop our model recommend the suitable fertilizer, this recommendation is based on the various soil properties.

1.2.	PROBLEM STATEMENT

•	Based on predicted rainfall, soil contents and weather parameters the system will recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation. 
•	Crop prediction is an essential task for the decision-makers at national and regional levels for rapid decision-making.
•	 It allows the farmers to choose any of the alternative combinations of fertilizers depending on the recommended crop and soil conditions.
•	An accurate crop yield prediction model can help farmers to decide on what to grow and when to grow

1.3.	CHALLENGES FACED IN THE SYSTEM

•	The major limitations of the Neural Network are reduction in the relative error and decreased prediction efficiency of Crop Yield.
•	Similarly, supervised learning techniques were incapable to capture the nonlinear bond between input and output variables faced a problem during the selection of
 fruits grading or sorting.
•	The existing model used SVM that classified the crop data based on the texture, shape, color of patterns on the diseased surface as it includes an unambiguous perception of the defects
•	An existing technique used CNN that reduced the relative error as well as decreased
 the prediction of crop yield.

1.4.	 SCOPE OF THE SYSTEM

System will check soil quality and predict the crop yield accordingly along with it provide fertilizer recommendation if needed depending upon the quality of soil. a fertilizer Selection Method improves net yield rate of the crop. It suggests a series of weather, soil type, water density, crop type.
